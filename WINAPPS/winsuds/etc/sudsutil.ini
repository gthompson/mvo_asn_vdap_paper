; This file contains initialization data for the various SUDS utilities.

; This file is arranged in sections.  Each section is marked with a
; "Section Header" inside square brakets (e.g., [SUDSPICK]). Each program
; will look for its section and then read the entries following its
; section header.  None of these entries are case-sensitive.  Comments
; are delimited by a pound-sign (#) or a semi-colon (;).  Blank lines
; are ignored.
